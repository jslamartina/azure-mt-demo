Example use:
``` bash
# In your CI step, you would run the following script to ensure that the migrations being applied will work across all Tenants
sudo bash test_flyway_with_backups.sh
# You would output the $commit_sha variable's value and give it to the CD step to download and apply the migrations
sudo bash apply_flyway.sh
```
